  <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
  <p>I asked my friends and family to review my website, while my family members didn't really notice anything wrong the site. Being more impressed with just the making of the webite. My friends noticed a new problems including incorrect links, ugly UI, and some image sizing problems.
  I realized how hard it was juggling so many different files and images and how easily you can just get lost. Most of my other projects were relativity simple but applying it all here was a real challenge. 
   I don't think I'm gonna do much HTLM or CSS work later on in life, I definetely learned a lot and now have a greater understanding of websites and their innner workings. I see things on a webite and actually understand how it's structured and how they did certain things, I don't think 
   I could have done that without this project. </p>
  <h3>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h3>
  <p>I think that the peanut analogy is really interesting. Firstly is the fact that this is a concept that many programmers seem to use, this makes me thing I would be able to find and see this philisophy of design in certain websites.
    Had I not read this article and had I not taken this class I would assume the visual aspect of websites were the most important. But after realizing how many lines of code are behind the content I now understand that a website is nothing without the content.
    A peanut M&M is nothing without the peanut.
